## Energy Customer Segmentation â€“ Machine Learning Case Study

This project focuses on performing customer segmentation for an energy services company using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Leveraging the Household Electricity Consumption dataset from Kaggle, which contains features such as date, time, energy usage (kWh), voltage, current, and power factor, the project aims to group customers into meaningful clusters based on their consumption patterns. The process involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and scaling, followed by clustering using the K-Means algorithm. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method and evaluated using the Silhouette Score, while PCA was applied for dimensionality reduction and visualization. Insights derived from the clusters can help the company personalize energy plans, implement dynamic pricing, design targeted marketing strategies, and optimize operational efficiency. The implementation was carried out in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
